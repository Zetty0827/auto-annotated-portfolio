title: Comparing Bitcoin to the S&P and the NASDAQ
date: '2025-07-24'
excerpt: >-
  I compared Bitcoin’s performance to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq using real market
  data from the past several years. The goal was to see how these popular
  indexes stack up against crypto in today’s markets—looking at growth, risk,
  and how each one handles market shocks.
