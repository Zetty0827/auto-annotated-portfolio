      ### I’m Massimo. I just graduated from Vanderbilt with a degree in
      economics and minors in computer science and Mediterranean studies. I’m
      from Miami and feel most like myself by the ocean, out in nature, or
      running around a tennis court or soccer field.


      ### I’ve been thinking a lot about how much of our lives are already
      wrapped up in technology, and how little say most people have in how it
      all works. In a class with Professor John Conley, I got to dig into the
      technical side: how platforms are built, how they monetize attention, how
      networks are structured, and how access can be limited or manipulated.
      While studying abroad, I took a course with Dr. Massimo Motta and learned
      how dominant companies use loopholes, lobbying, and market design to block
      out competitors and entrench their power.


      ### That combination of theory and real-world mechanics made something
      click. I don’t just want to understand these systems — I want to push back
      on the way they’re built. I believe access to technology should be treated
      like infrastructure, not a privilege. That means rethinking how we
      regulate, how we define competition, and how we protect people, not just
      markets.


      ### This site is where I think out loud. I’ll be writing about digital
      power, economic systems, and the future I want to help build — one where
      access, fairness, and accountability aren’t optional.
